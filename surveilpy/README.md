Your friendly CLI to display metrics of your server with histograms, gauges and charts "on your terminal itself"!

## Problem Statement 
There are a plethora of ways of monitoring your remotely hosted servers on some public cloud. And monitoring them is a crucial deed considering the fact that it helps you facilitate scaling decisions. Now, setting up monitoring is a hectic task like dealing with elasticsearch, logstash, kibana, grafana, Prometheus and what not.

## About my talk 
I'll talk and teach live about building a monitoring library, surveilpy, from scratch in Python which will display all the relevant metrics like CPU Usage, memory usage, diskio, file, network bandwidth and what not on the Terminal UI itself in the form of gauges, piecharts, histograms and line charts. The terminal itself is going to have UI embedded in it.

**So, install surveilpy and just execute one command to fetch and display every possible relevant metric of your remote server in front of your eyes, on the terminal itself!**
